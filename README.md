# **Breast Cancer Clustering Project**
  
### Analyzing breast cancer data using clustering techniques. Data available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/breast-cancer-dataset/data

## **Project Goal**
The goal of this project is to apply the KMeans algorithm to the analysis of breast cancer data to identify clusters among breast cancer cases. Clustering allows the detection of patterns and subgroups that may be difficult to spot using other data analysis methods.

By identifying clusters, the project aims to:
1. **Understand the diversity of breast cancer cases:** Identify different types of breast cancer cases that may have similar features or characteristics.
2. **Pattern discovery:** Uncovering hidden patterns in the data, such as relationships between cancer types and other patient characteristics, which can lead to new directions for research and therapy.
3. **Diagnosis and Treatment Support:** Provide physicians and researchers with information that can help personalize diagnosis and treatment plans for different patient groups.

## **Main steps of the analysis**
- **Loading, analyze dataset and exclude highly correlated data:** Initial analysis and exclusion of highly correlated data.
- **Data preprocessing:** Scaling the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering.
-  **Implementation of KMeans algorithm:**. 
   - **Determining the optimal number of clusters:** Applying the elbow method to select the appropriate number of clusters.
   - **Data clustering:** Performing clustering using KMeans algorithm.
- **Analysis of clusterization results:** Evaluation and interpretation of clusters, including analysis of dominant characteristics in each cluster.
- **Visualization:** Create charts to show clustering results.
